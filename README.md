# 🔍 Prime Number Checker (Python)

This simple Python script checks whether a given number is a **prime number** — a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The script takes a predefined number (`num = 2`)
2. It checks:
   - If the number is less than or equal to 1 → not prime
   - If the number is greater than 1 → loops through possible divisors
3. If any divisor is found, it prints why it's not prime.
4. If no divisor is found, it's declared a prime number.

## 📌 Example

```python
num = 2
